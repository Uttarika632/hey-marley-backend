So can I, am I audible? Wow, okay, this is going fast. Alright, so, I think one of the things that I've realized is that I love product building and crafting and it's like baking, right? So I love like I think that was what I really missed in my life like just, that is what I was looking for, like you know it probably wasn't so much to do with a mission but it was more about building great products for people and building and crafting and yeah, just designing that's why I think I was always like very, I always wanted to learn graphics and stuff like that but I really just never got myself good which is very dumb of me. Well, not too old at 35 to figure it out, huh? Anyway, so I think one of those things that I really need to you know, get myself to do, which has kind of become an important aspect is just getting better at the craft of product building. So how I see this happening now is that I'm working on my portfolio, resume building, all of that is going to happen I just need to like do small talks with folks and continue with my engagement with AXSTEP because I think AXSTEP is going to run till March where I'm going to help them out with building this and I think I want to do a really good job, like I don't want to just do it for the sake of doing it because that would really help in creating some, crafting some really good looking products and something that actually really helps in the combination of research and research and implementation which is exactly what they're looking for and how somehow it just fit that I'm helping them out and I think I can also make this like a great portfolio example where I can talk about how this reached like millions of students right, so it's a great opportunity for me to really do a good job here Yes, money part, they're not paying anything, they're not really brought it up, they're just like oh yeah, she just wants to do this, it's like a purposeful sort of mission, but I do think that they might push back saying I want this and I want that and I have to like really push back and drop boundaries So that is one So what I'm going to do in December would just be building Hemali out from actual coding, so that means that I'll have to get really good with code I have to get good with the craft of coding because that's what's going to help me really build good products I think I'm decent at designing a prototype level but I need to get better at the technical part of it only because that'll help me become a better product manager So yeah, I think the next two weeks, we are on 9th today at least till like the 20th of next weekend, like I'm just going to go full on on building and then from the 20th till 27th, I'm going to work on my IELTS exam, I'm just going to prep for that and go all in on focusing just on that I think the best way I work is by just doing one thing at a time If I do multiple things I fail miserably so it's important for me to be very mindful of that. So for the next two weeks, I think I would want to create a good working product with LimeChain. We have like 10 days to do this, right? So we are on 9th today so a good working product with yeah, and then also spend some time with your resume, talk to your co-strategy session with the folks try to I think, I don't think I should try I should just finish a very basic play-fix you know sort of piece to just get people to understand the kind of work we have done in the last one year yeah, so 12th March so March 2024 is when I started and we are at you can say like July of 2025 I paused it right, so 2025 July is when I paused doing it and March, April, May and July, so that's like 4 plus 12 16 months, but we can say 18 or 20 months right so yeah, so I think this is the kind of clarity that I start having in my life you know, and yeah, I think it's important for me to get out of India, I think the only sort of work I want to do here is either work with one of the big tech companies here could potentially work for a start-up for sure but I think start-up which is higher younger folks here with less sort of experience than me currently so I don't know if I am going to get into the start-up world specifically in India and also like it will be very bad, yeah very bad work ethics and I don't want to get into that so yeah I think that's what I've realised about myself, I just love building, I love kneading I love learning and I just want to have a craft of building purely good products and I think I just have to see myself as that as a designer as someone who can understand what humans really want and then build based off that not a designer per se but like a designer and a builder that's how I see myself so yeah I think it's really about going all in and just focusing on that and just giving it your best shot and yeah I think like focusing on your craft every day would be the inclusion right, so for the next 10 days I would just be sitting and working on Lanchine and just getting myself good as a coder getting with prompt engineering which is like another piece that needs a lot of attention and also developing production level sort of yeah production level systems you
